The Battle of Hogwarts coming to a pause in the distance, Severus Snape lay slumped against a dented wall in the Shrieking Shack. 
His neck was shredded, blood soaking crisp white collar and pooling on the dusty wooden floor around him. 
He had been left there, his eyes closed and his head slumped, tears streaming down his greying face. 
Yet, against all odds, Severus was not yet dead.
Unconscious and barely clinging to life, but not yet dead.
Alone with countless wounds to his throat and chest, one would a this was the end for him regardless. 
Voldemort's chilling telepathic message to gather the dead barely penetrated his flickering mind.
They found the wall between Platforms Nine and Ten. 
There were other young witches and wizards who were eager to cross over to the other side, they just had to wait fo muggles to be distracted long enough for them to slip through. 
She shifted her weight uncomfortably as she watched a couple of students rush up and then disappear beyo brick facade. 
Corinna never watched someone do that before, and she felt a slight shiver run down her spine. 
Before she could fully process what was happening, Mr. Crou grabbed her arm and ushered her through the barrier. 
She blinked and it was over. 
She was on the platform with the scarlet steam engine, glistening with golden letters advertising the fact that it was the Hogwarts Express.
Much to Corinna's annoyance, they agreed to split up and look for the toad. 
Corinna went down the train towards the caboose, asking various groups of people, knowing futhat she was now going to be known as the first year who asked everyone about some other kid's toad. 
All she hoped was that people understood that it was someone elsetoad, not hers. Not that anyone cared, really. 
All anyone was really talking about how the boy who lived was on the train. 
It took her by surprise that she was, if the rumortrue, going to be in the same year as that boy who defeated the darkest but greatest wizard of the age.
Corinna felt like her heart was lodged in her throat as she shuffled along with the other nervous first years, dreading what was to come. 
They all gathered towards the fronwhere a stool sat with a shabby looking hat perched on it. 
The last thing she expected was the hat to open at one of the seams and start to sing. 
As she was at the edge ogroup, she glanced over at those sitting at the nearest table. 
They seemed to watch the hat with disinterest, so it was something the article of clothing did often. 
Simply, snot think there would be any more surprises when it came to the world she grew up in.
It was a quiet night in the Janus Thickney Ward at St. Mungos for Magical Maladies and Injuries. 
A young healer was sitting at the reception counter quietly reading a mag about a possible cure for lycanthropy on the horizon in Witch Weekly. 
The study was being led by Damocles Belby, a man who had originally invented the Wolfsbane potion was fascinating to learn how much one man had affected the field of healing in the past decade. 
She herself had worked on several werewolves throughout her short durat being a fully trained healer, and they were almost always the worst cases. 
She had been told that in comparison to the days when Fenrir Greyback was amongst the living far worse, and that children came in infected often, but thankfully the man was put in the ground by Hermione Granger during the Battle of Hogwarts.
