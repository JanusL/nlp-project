If we consider two areas , the Southern Cau ##cas ##us and the Black Sea area , we can see that the mut ##ual relationship ##s between the countries are usually under - developed , whether they are bilateral or multi ##late ##ral .
Even if the Bela ##rus ##ian parliament ##ary elections , observed by the OS ##CE , did not meet the requirements for fair and free elections , next week ' s sit ##ting of the Council of Minister ##s will in all proba ##bility give the green light for political dialogu ##e .
As stated in the communication , although demand for agricultural comm ##odi ##ties is also influenced by the bio ##fu ##el market , Commission analys ##es indicate that current European bio ##fu ##el production has little impact on current global food price ##s .
Although this is not currently an area of code ##cis ##ion , Parliament has worked in this spirit and this fact should be utili ##sed by the government ##s .
If not , Uga ##nda ##n and Bur ##und ##ian forces will pull away from Mog ##adi ##shu leaving a security ga ##p behind .
I want to con ##grat ##ulat ##e the rap ##port ##eur , Mrs Mart ##ens , on the compre ##hensive and balanc ##ed definition of the new strateg ##y as set out in her excellen ##t report .
Fourt ##hl ##y , all countries are interest ##ed in the Cau ##cas ##us , including the United States and the countries of the European Union .
If we want to lead the European Union into a product ##ive future , we in this Parliament must push for more democra ##cy , including in the process of cho ##osi ##ng people to fill the top positions .
The aim was to contribut ##e to a global strateg ##y when the World Health Assembly meets in May next year .
CI ##TE ##S constitu ##ted the principal global agreement on the conservation of wild species with the aim of avoid ##ing the over - explo ##itation of species of wild fau ##na and flor ##a by international trade .
Member of the Commission . - Mada ##m President , just a short response to M ##s Andreas ##en , Mr Hart ##ong , Mr Bel ##der , Mr Van ##hec ##ke , Mr Fa ##jmo ##n , Mr Vla ##s ##á ##k and Mr Bron ##s - the latter being in opposition to Parliament ' s position on the budget and the proposal of the Commission .
( CS ) Mr President , if we want to revi ##tali ##se the European economy and boo ##st competitive ##ness in the global environment , our core objecti ##ve must be , finally , after 20 years , to remov ##e all barri ##ers preventi ##ng small and medium - size ##d enter ##prise ##s in particular from developing their business activities .
In order to moderat ##e the virtu ##ous intention ##s here , my counter - proposal is that conce ##ssions should be made on other industrial products .
There ##fore , in order that we in Europe can live with a common understanding in the future , we have draft ##ed a question for the Council and the Commission .
Today we talk of European ##isa ##tion , we send in troops and officials , we spend a great deal of money and , at the same time , we are imprison ##ing young people in these countries .
The vot ##ing procedure used today meant that this particular proposal could not be teste ##d by Parliament as a whole .
( DE ) Mada ##m President , Commissioner , the question of agriculture played a relatively important role in the Irish ' no ' campaign .
( DE ) Mr President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , we are strong ##ly opposed to the death penalty , where ##ver in the world it is enforce ##d .
( DE ) Mr President , this report send ##s an important signal to a country that is playing a stabil ##isin ##g role , has exe ##mpl ##ary legislation on minorit ##ies , has a broad government majority in which all nationali ##ties are represented and has taken a clear European course under the leadership of Prime Minister Gru ##evsk ##i .
Inde ##ed , Norway ' s Minister for Fisher ##ies and Coast ##al Affairs spoke highly of the EU ' s cooperati ##on in this regard .
The fact that the Commission has recommend ##ed the opening of negotiat ##ions with F ##Y ##RO ##M should be seen as a clear message that this country is on the right track .
There can ##not be une ##qua ##l treatment of workers who come to Europe .
As dialogu ##e is very much a sin ##e qua non for success , I would like to say to you , on beha ##lf of my group , that you represent the person ##ification of dialogu ##e .
Sup ##pl ##y that is not rig ##oro ##usl ##y regulat ##ed would have a negative impact on the needs and the beha ##vio ##ur of individual EU citizens , and here I am specifically refer ##ring to the most vul ##nera ##ble groups and to young people .
The allo ##cation of financial support needs to be based first and fore ##most on efficien ##cy ; if efficien ##cy is the primary cri ##teri ##on , then electric ##ity generation is virtual ##ly the only thin ##g worth supporting .
The Commission document entitled ' To ##wards a new Energy Strat ##eg ##y for Europe 2011 - 2020 ' makes an excellen ##t contributi ##on to a compre ##hensive EU policy for the energy sector in the context of the EU 2020 strateg ##y .
The dead ##lock is due , in particular , to the fact that the Hai ##tia ##n state does not have the capacity to provide basic public services using its own resources .
May I also than ##k Commission President Barr ##oso for his remark ##s , particularly to remi ##nd us of the importance of jobs and especially of the need to focus on those unf ##ort ##unate people who do not yet have one .
Second less ##on : the 27 must concentrat ##e on their budget ##ary polici ##es very early on in proceed ##ings .
The second issue is that if we demand that others should comp ##ly with their undertak ##ings as well as with reason ##able laws that comp ##ly with basic freedom ##s , then we should respect these laws our ##sel ##ves .
Second ##ly , over and above any debate about the mista ##kes and mis ##gui ##ded action of the Greek Government , we need to bear this in mind : in their evalua ##tion of the polici ##es being proposed and applied by Europe to deal with the cris ##is , our fellow citizens are saying to us : ' We have our limit ##s .
Second ##ly , I wish to mention the exe ##mpl ##ary work of Islamic N ##GO ##s on beha ##lf of religious toleranc ##e .
The social , economic and even political effects of keep ##ing European air ##spa ##ce closed for a longer period may prove to be a col ##oss ##al challenge for the whole of Europe .
This direct ##ive must now be implement ##ed quickly by the Member States , so that the serious problems caused by the establishment of long payment terms and the drag ##ging out of payment ##s are finally reso ##lved .
The citizens have entr ##ust ##ed us with the right to exercise authority on their beha ##lf .
One way to achieve this objecti ##ve would be to learn as a second foreign language languages other than international languages .
- ( EL ) Mada ##m President , Commissioner , we all agree that Cop ##enha ##gen must be crown ##ed with success , because both the cre ##di ##bility of the political world and the surviv ##al of future generation ##s are at stak ##e .
Just as important as this break ##thr ##ough is a break ##thr ##ough on the Work ##ing Time Direct ##ive ; not of the kind proposed by Mr Bush ##ill - Matthew ##s , however , but with absol ##ute ##ly no op ##t - outs , as proposed at Parliament ' s reading .
One side want ##s the total conservation of a long list of species that are on the ver ##ge of exti ##nct ##ion .
E - justice is necessary at a time when the number of people involved in cross - border lit ##igati ##on in Europe is estimated at 10 million .
( ES ) Russia is a very important international player , a permanent member of the Security Council and the G ##8 and a major military power .
The EU must be ambi ##tio ##us in the battle against climate change , which means that the role of nuclear power and rene ##wa ##ble energy sources can ##not be disco ##unte ##d .
That Europe should co ##opera ##te in finding lasti ##ng solution ##s for Ye ##meni prisoner ##s , the largest contin ##gent left in Guan ##t ##án ##amo Bay .
European industry has shown that we can count on its commit ##ment to search ##ing for innovat ##ive solution ##s which will help in the fight against climate change .
The European Union should play a more active role in Ukraine ; we should stop the practice that has preva ##iled over the last few years of the European Union treat ##ing one of the largest states in Europe in an unc ##erta ##in and half - heart ##ed way .
The European Union must express its solid ##arit ##y with the people ##s in the Arab countries who are on the streets now or have been .
Until it is set up , I would ask the European Om ##bud ##sman to pass on each complain ##t directly to the national or regional om ##bud ##sman with the appropriate compete ##nce .
The European Parliament today adopted a resolution calling for the EU ' s relations with Syri ##a , Bah ##rain and Ye ##men to be rea ##sse ##ssed in order to take account of the popular upri ##sing ##s in those countries .
The European Council of June this year provided a strong political boo ##st by con ##grat ##ulati ##ng the Commission on its wish to present its proposal , but the Council ' s mandat ##e is cry ##stal clear : we have to find a funding solution which fully compli ##es with the current Financial Pers ##pective .
Fil ##ial leave to care for depende ##nt family members was included in the consult ##ation of the European social partner ##s on the recon ##cil ##iat ##ion of work , private and family life .
( FR ) Mada ##m President , Commissioner , any country that is not in control of how to process its own was ##te should not be allowed to use the technology that has produced the was ##te .
( FR ) Mr President , President of the Commission , I would like to ask you , in the context of this 2020 strateg ##y and , in particular , of the system of enhanc ##ed govern ##ance , how you wish to deal with the issue of lob ##bie ##s .
Georgi Pir ##inski , the Speak ##er of Bulgaria ' s Parliament , restrict ##s the freedom of speech by impos ##ing proh ##ibit ##ions on journalist ##s , thus preventi ##ng them from doing their job .
I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that it can help the Lib ##yan people to improve their living conditions , which are often condition ##ed by a lack of respect for human rights and the most basic freedom ##s .
I voted in favour of this resolution , because I feel that there is a need to enhanc ##e policy on protect ##ing children ' s rights .
Tak ##ing a broad hol ##istic view , our legislation needs to be upgrade ##d or developed in a more strategi ##c and co ##here ##nt manner : cla ##rif ##ying roles and respon ##si ##bilities ; align ##ing as far as possible with international standards ; drawing strong ##ly on scientific adv ##ice and the prec ##aut ##ionar ##y principle where appropriate .
With respect to the ' delegat ##ed acts ' procedure ##s , we are concern ##ed that the procedure would be considera ##bly delay ##ed , making management of the fund very difficult .
Learn ##ing from the positive out ##come in Nag ##oya in October and the negative experience from Cop ##enha ##gen in 2009 , I think that the EU will speak with a single voice .
Rega ##rdi ##ng the particular situation of one of the prisoner ##s mentioned by the honour ##able Member , the European Union has made a manifesta ##tion of solid ##arit ##y initiat ##ed by the Swedish Pres ##ide ##ncy in Hava ##na in August .
Mrs Jackson , I have known you personal ##ly for many years and I have no dou ##bt ##s at all about your personal integrit ##y .
Mada ##m President , first of all I would like to than ##k M ##s Pol ##fer for her excellen ##t work and excellen ##t cooperati ##on .
Mada ##m President , the CF ##SP has become almost everything , so you can say almost everything in a debate like this .
Ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , democra ##cy is not shared , nor is totalitar ##ian ##ism .
Ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , the war has left a prof ##ound impressi ##on on Georgia ##ns and the country is still faci ##ng fundamental problems , such as meeting the basic needs of thousands of disp ##lace ##d persons .
The economy and social co ##hes ##ion in our countries constitu ##te a fundamental prior ##ity .
Commissioner , know ##ing your atta ##chm ##ent to Europe , I believe that you will agree with me that the solution ##s we are debat ##ing today , the way in which we shall manage this cris ##is , will no dou ##bt be a major chapter in European history .
on beha ##lf of the S & D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , if one listen ##s att ##enti ##vel ##y to the speech ##es of Mr Van Rom ##pu ##y and Mr Barr ##oso , one might be remi ##nde ##d of a famous German song whose words go something like ' All hands on dec ##k , but the ship is a wr ##eck ' .
Mr President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , I should first of all like to than ##k the President , who is doing us the honour of chair ##ing a debate on an issue that is so very important for industrial policy and the internal market .
Mr President , Commissioner , first ##ly I would like to extend my very warm than ##ks for our successful work together to the rap ##port ##eur from the Committee on Civil Libert ##ies , Justice and Home Affairs , Mr Dep ##rez , all the sha ##dow rap ##port ##eur ##s , and the representative ##s of the Czech Pres ##ide ##ncy and the European Commission .
Final ##ly , Mr President , I really do not think that this question of lob ##by ##ing can be settled by stating that we dis ##like it , or by criminal ##isin ##g lob ##bie ##s .
- Mr President , President Obama said : ' America has no better partner than Europe ' .
Mr President , this is a private matter for the EP ##P , and I do not see why the Assembly should be bore ##d with it .
Mr Prod ##i , we have adopted Amend ##ment 3 , which therefore replace ##s the whole resolution .
I am talk ##ing , in particular , about the need to reform the United Nations ( UN ) system to assi ##gn the Union a place and , in particular , about its representation on the UN Security Council .
It is a kind of pap ##yr ##us that I am un ##rol ##ling in front of you .
It is about providing training and retr ##ain ##ing and impro ##ving skills to prepare people and help them find a job .
At the same time , after ##mat ##h intervent ##ion demand ##s large - scale cooperati ##on between different national authorities inside a Member State .
( HU ) Mada ##m President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , first of all , than ##k you for giving me the opportunity to speak on beha ##lf of the Hungarian delegat ##ion of the European People ' s Party .
In 2011 , as ICC ##AT have proposed , this will underg ##o a redu ##ction of at least 50 % to under 6 750 ton ##nes .
We have a land ca ##das ##tre and we will work on it , but there could be risk ##s .
Information on the size of the charges , and what they cons ##ist of , must be provided open ##ly .
In principle , the EU institutions encourage this , but it is high time for action to be taken to change things .
The Irish people , by a reso ##und ##ing majority , recognise ##d the importance of the Lis ##bon Treat ##y , a Treat ##y that offers a more democra ##tic and effective Europe , a Treat ##y that gives us the right platform to deliver the modern , successful European Union our citizens wish to see .
( IT ) Mada ##m President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , I ask whether the propo ##ser of the amen ##dm ##ent would agree to remov ##e the two ph ##rase ##s which currently read : ' in some rare instance ##s ' and ' which may not be law ##ful ' from the sentence .
( IT ) Mr President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , I am just going to speak for a few seconds to say that I agree with a good part of Mr Cap ##pat ##o ' s report .
The switch - off of analog ##ue radio broadcasting will free up spect ##rum in the U ##HF band , which is particularly appeal ##ing due to the propa ##gation properties of U ##HF radio wave ##s .
It highlight ##s the fact that the rule of law is nothing but a meaning ##less concept in Venezuela .
For this reason , media litera ##cy can also be under ##sto ##od in the extended sense of access to new information techno ##logi ##es and the critical hand ##ling of the content such techno ##logi ##es provide .
Any re - admi ##ssion agreement between the European Union and Lib ##ya has to excl ##ude all those who claim to be as ##yl ##um seek ##ers , refuge ##es or persons re ##quir ##ing international protection , and it must be applied completely in acc ##ord ##ance with the principle of non - ref ##oul ##ement .
It is clear , therefore , that we in Europe are not read ##y for this and that therefore our trains will be unable , or insu ##ffic ##ient ##ly able , to communi ##cate with these new signal ##ling install ##ations .
It is cru ##el and dem ##ean ##ing , and a puni ##shm ##ent to which an inn ##ocen ##t person can be sentence ##d .
What you are going to sign tom ##or ##row is a Treat ##y none of you has read it , simply because it is not possible to read it .
What this really means , in plain language , is that we will have even more one - side ##d government propagand ##a coming our way for multi ##cul ##tura ##lis ##m , which has been a complete failure , and mass immigrat ##ion .
In any case , I wish you every success , both here and in Brus ##sel ##s .
Also what prior ##ity is the President - in - Office giving to border adju ##stm ##ent measures or ban ##s ?
With regard to energy security , it is clear that we have less ##ons to draw .
As far as this issue is concern ##ed , as you know , the Commission takes the view that the existing tool ##s of the carbon dio ##xi ##de emi ##ssions system should be extended by introduc ##ing a sector ##al credit mechanism .
Who ##ever makes early use of them will create million ##s of jobs for their citizens and a prospe ##rou ##s society .
As I think it is time to summ ##ari ##se , I want to say that we natural ##ly agree with the whole report , but with regard to the reforms and amen ##dm ##ents still pen ##ding , I would like to say two things that I think are appropriate .
Because the birth rate has been dec ##rea ##sing since the 1970s and because people live longer , an ever - smaller number of people of working age will have to support a ever - larger number of people who are outside working age .
In spi ##te of our fair ##ly distan ##t initial negotiat ##ing positions , we have managed to reach a comp ##romi ##se , which , I hope , will allow us to come to an understanding with the Council at first reading .
Never ##theless , the majority of this House has given the Commission a tru ##ly blank che ##que by setting ambi ##gu ##ous limit ##ations such as ' propor ##tional ##ity ' or ' reci ##pro ##cit ##y ' .
What evalua ##tion cri ##teria are applied remains a central question , despite all efforts .
Farmer ##s have budget ##ed on the current system remaining in place until 2013 .
Co ##hes ##ion policy not only plays a key role in ac ##hie ##ving the objecti ##ves of the Europe 2020 strateg ##y ; its primary task is to strength ##en European integr ##ation and solid ##arit ##y by reduci ##ng the social , economic and territori ##al difference ##s that still unf ##ort ##unate ##ly exist within the European Union .
When a million citizens sign a peti ##tion , the Commission agree ##s to deal with it , but is that all there is to it ?
The Commissioner said she would respon ##d to the out ##come of Bali in the preli ##mina ##ry draft budget , along the lines of formula ##ting a new Asia strateg ##y .
The Commission should do more , including with regard to award ##ing grant ##s to the car industry .
The Commission is already obli ##ged to draft a report on the read ##ability of the packag ##e lea ##fle ##t .
From the very beginning , the Commission has supported the students in Vil ##niu ##s , and I would like to see more support from the various Member States , because the ones that always speak up about this should also do something .
The Commission , Parliament and the Council have decided to join together in giving a specific response to small and medium - size ##d enter ##prise ##s ( SM ##E ##s ) by implement ##ing part of the Small Business Act .
The Commission conclu ##des in their Imp ##act Asse ##ss ##ment , when looking at the different option ##s concern ##ing these 8 metro ##logy direct ##ives ( full repe ##al , repe ##al with conditions , do nothing ) , that ' no option stands out ' .
The communi ##st experiment was not the answer there , but nei ##ther was the neo - liberal experiment .
In conclu ##sion , I have already invited the authority that manage ##s Gali ##le ##o to visit us in Prag ##ue .
When deal ##ing with risi ##ng food price ##s and food cris ##es in some parts of the world we also have to address the issues of the quality and quant ##ity of food , which is one of the fundamental aspects of the lives of every man , woman , family or nation on this planet .
When we listen ##ed to certain people as a delegat ##ion , and heard testi ##mon ##y regarding the rights of women and minorit ##ies in Iran , they told us that perhaps it would be better to impos ##e symbol ##ic sanct ##ions , such as cultural sanct ##ions .
As was mentioned , long ##evi ##ty should be a rew ##ard and not a puni ##shm ##ent .
As the Commissioner says , the health check is a good opportunity , because until the EU takes action to tack ##le that ele ##phan ##t in the room , all the good efforts like this packag ##e will continue to be overs ##had ##owe ##d and lose out in the noi ##se .
As rap ##port ##eur for matter ##s relati ##ng to the energy performance of buildings , I call on the EU to provide innovat ##ive financial instruments to boo ##st the investment ##s in the use of rene ##wa ##ble energy sources and in impro ##ving energy efficien ##cy , especially for buildings and in the transport sector .
As I have said , the only way to era ##dica ##te pove ##rt ##y is to allow growth in the developing world .
I believe , and many of you have emphasi ##sed , that preventi ##on means era ##dica ##ting hat ##red and eliminat ##ing the reasons for hat ##red , without ever just ##if ##ying violence , since the grave ##st risk we run is to begin just ##if ##ying violence .
When I hea ##r , out in the field , how hard it is to obtain money from the Stru ##ctur ##al Fund ##s , I find it sca ##rce ##ly cre ##di ##ble that the control ##s are not ad ##equ ##ate , because more and more I am hearing people say ' someone else can have my share - it is far too compli ##cated being involved with the Fund ##s ' .
Fortun ##atel ##y , I did not do it through my first mandat ##e , otherwise I would never have had lun ##ch in Strasbourg .
I can ##not but be glad that a settlement has been reached on what is for me , as a parent , such a key piece of legislation .
Just three months ago , we draft ##ed a resolution in this House on the exe ##cution ##s in Iran .
2007 was the first year of the new 2007 - 2013 multi ##ann ##ual financial frame ##work in which a number of new rules were implement ##ed .
The Lis ##bon strateg ##y failed due to the rel ##uct ##ance of the Member States to keep their own promise ##s .
( L ##T ) Mada ##m President , in the European Union , we stand for the principle of consume ##r , in this case , pati ##ent , aware ##ness and are aim ##ing for citizens to part ##ly take responsibility for their own health .
A little opti ##mis ##m is a good thin ##g , but even the most pes ##sim ##istic among ##st us can ##not believe that we will still be in the mid ##st of a cris ##is in the year 2012 .
International human rights organisation ##s severe ##ly criticis ##e President Gay ##oo ##m because of the auto ##crat ##ic nature of his regi ##me and the many serious human rights viola ##tions by his country ' s police and security services .
While appre ##ciat ##ing the construct ##ive approach of Parliament , the Commission can ##not therefore accept some of the amen ##dm ##ents in their present form .
In the meant ##ime , in Dar ##fur , President al - Bas ##hir is expe ##lling organisation ##s which are trying to reso ##lve this key issue .
I think that two funds should be set up : one for the needs of the EU and one for other countries in order to avoid a situation where there are no funds left for assistance to poor countries .
I think the Pres ##ide ##ncy has been working under stric ##t time cons ##tra ##int ##s , since the Commission ' s proposal was submit ##ted on 6 October 2010 and we are now prepa ##ring our conclu ##sions for the Council meeting of 26 November .
I believe that everything possible must be done to ensure that it is always a feature of our public life .
I take the view that the issue of nationali ##sm , this culture of impu ##nit ##y , with four wanted criminal ##s - and not small fr ##y either - still running around free in Serbia , is into ##lera ##ble .
In my view , this is not about transp ##aren ##cy ; it is simply the reflect ##ion of an anti - cler ##ical att ##itude , and we should say ' no ' to that .
I think it is legitim ##ate and fair - I have already done so and not just to be poli ##te - to heart ##ily con ##grat ##ulat ##e the Portuguese Pres ##ide ##ncy on its work .
We believe it is necessary to have balanc ##ed access to the global food supply , but that this will not be helped by either maintain ##ing or extend ##ing the EU ' s agricultural aid .
We , on the other hand , love Hungary , think highly of the Hungarian Government and , what is more , are sha ##mel ##ess ##ly chee ##ring your party on .
I believe that it is time for solution ##s to stop following the traditional principle encourage ##d by Tall ##ey ##rand , which is to dance and then come to a clear , firm decision .
I believe that when we become adults , we appre ##ciat ##e ratio ##nal argument ##s , and if we have been well educated , we recognise when ratio ##nal argument ##s are fair .
I do not think this has any basis in the law and certain ##ly it would not meet with a favour ##able recepti ##on from the public .
Many may say , of course , that in a formal sense , this overs ##ight already existe ##d .
Per ##hap ##s my question is a little unf ##air , because it has a historical pers ##pective .
My question is : Has the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on similar cases and could these cases be cite ##d in the context of this type of access restrict ##ion ?
We must concentrat ##e on those countries where the EN ##P ' s key objecti ##ve of bringing neighbour ##ing countries close ##r to Europe appears the most ac ##hie ##va ##ble .
If the government falls it will defini ##tely not threaten the Pres ##ide ##ncy and the fact that the socialis ##ts did not care that the Czech Republic was presi ##ding over the European Council and refused even the most basic cooperati ##on will be dama ##ging mainly to social democra ##cy .
Design ##ing a reform packag ##e for European political parties as a means of mobi ##lis ##ing the democra ##tic energi ##es of individual and organise ##d citizens is not an easy task , not least due to the EU ' s system ##ic complex ##ity .
On the other , we wish to express strong reserv ##ations ( see point 3 , in particular ) .
In my opinion it is most important that the work of the Member States , as well as that of the Commission and the Pres ##ide ##ncy , remains transparent .
I would like to comment on the statement by Mr Hol ##m and stres ##s that the EU ##FO ##R mission in Cha ##d is part of MI ##NU ##RC ##AT , the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Cha ##d .
First , because Member States do not keep their word , which means that all the work carried out by European institutions ends up being worth ##less .
May I give you one piece of adv ##ice : keep Europe focused on its core task .
Final ##ly , I should like to than ##k Mr Bel ##der for the work he has done with the sha ##dow rap ##port ##eur ##s so that we were able to balanc ##e this report and make it accept ##able to the entire European Parliament .
I therefore hope , by way of conclu ##sion , that the vote will endo ##rse the text agreed by the Committee on Fisher ##ies .
The aim of the report is to assess the achievement ##s of the Council , and compar ##e the expe ##cta ##tions with the results .
We should instead phase out the subs ##idi ##es for the common agricultural policy ( CA ##P ) and the Stru ##ctur ##al Fund ##s , but unf ##ort ##unate ##ly , the proposal that was voted through goes in the opposite direction .
Interna ##lly , Europe has the task of implement ##ing the energy and climate packag ##e and invest ##ing in clean techno ##logi ##es , scientific research and energy efficien ##cy .
In the field of avia ##tion security it is therefore essential that we equi ##p our ##sel ##ves with fle ##xi ##ble instruments that make it possible to create an at ##mospher ##e of maximum protection for citizens , and that can be easily and ad ##equ ##atel ##y evalua ##ted .
For example , tens of million ##s of migrant workers lead lives of sha ##me ##ful mise ##ry , with their children suffer ##ing the consequen ##ces of the horr ##ific conditions under which they live .
The task we face is not only to safe ##guar ##d the future of farmi ##ng in Europe and the quality and quant ##ity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure that data are protected .
To that end , our institutions need to work closely together and the European Parliament has to be fully consult ##ed in its role , ye ##s , as joint policy - make ##r for Europe , but more important ##ly as the citizens ' representative in the key political act that is the adopt ##ion of the budget .
The next author , Mr Tou ##ssa ##s , who is absen ##t , and Mr Zi ##obr ##o , will receive written repli ##es , as explain ##ed earlier .
The next it ##em is the debate concern ##ing an oral question to the Commission from Gius ##epp ##e Gar ##gani , on beha ##lf of the Committee on Lega ##l Affairs - B ##6 - 000 ##2 / 2008 ) concern ##ing the status of ME ##P ##s elected in Poland .
General ##ly speaking , greater financial in ##put is required for changes to be effective .
Fortun ##atel ##y , the Commissioner has already indicate ##d in his speech a minute ago that he will initiat ##e such an investigation and that he will take the matter serious ##ly .
These are not easy questions to answer and they were the subject of heat ##ed debate both in this House and in the Council for a number of years .
Then we plan to introduc ##e a food label ##ling system in which food ##s with a low sug ##ar , fat and sal ##t content would have a green traffic light on the label and those with a high content a red traffic light .
After all , now ##here does the European Commission put European citizens first , now ##here does it show respect for them .
Final ##ly , as Mrs Mal ##ms ##tr ##ö ##m has said , democra ##cy building is much more than about elections : it is about building plu ##rali ##st civil society .
Un ##fort ##unate ##ly , only some Member States have recognise ##d that the exter ##mination of the Roma was actually an act of genocid ##e .
We should not disco ##unt the poss ##ibilit ##y that Luka ##she ##nko is black ##mai ##ling the Krem ##lin , which has hit ##her ##to been vit ##al to his stran ##gle ##hold on political power .
There has been the recent depo ##rta ##tion by the Government of Pakistan of another returning civilian politician , Na ##wa ##z Shar ##if .
However compli ##cated it may be , we need to return to the liberali ##sation of the market in services , and we need to review the services direct ##ive that was adopted .
One thin ##g is certain : a food label can ##not be a manu ##al for health ##y eat ##ing .
While some aspects of the resolution are inde ##ed positive , Amend ##ment 10 was deci ##sive for me .
We can ##not go on like this , and I look forward to a new start where we base decision ##s , especially about data storage and transfer , on our basic bed ##rock principle ##s of propor ##tional ##ity , nece ##ssi ##ty and legal processi ##ng .

This Syn ##od can ##not be registered and has no legal basis .
This trag ##ed ##y has brought all product ##ive sector ##s , small and medium - size ##d enter ##prise ##s , and various other sector ##s , to their kne ##es .

This is pro ##of of the confid ##ence placed in my country , bear ##ing in mind as well the professional ##ism which has been demonstrate ##d by the Romanian army in Afghan ##istan and Iraq .

I hope that the IG ##C can be able to examin ##e the question with sufficien ##t care .
I hope this , too , au ##gur ##s well for the support that the President can count on .
We hope that relations between Poland and Germany will continue to develop , for the good of our citizens and of Europe as a whole .

Many aspects of transp ##aren ##cy in Parliament have improved , as you can see in the report .
We know that it did not achieve much in terms of substan ##ce , but this is understand ##able , since all meeting ##s at the present time are overs ##had ##owe ##d by what is a very fra ##ught situation .
However , it should not be seen as an end in itself in front of which the social consequen ##ces do not matter .
However , this country managed to become independent and now can bo ##ast of a G ##DP growth of over 8 % , and even 9 . 9 % in the years 2003 - 2006 .
However , we consider that the discussion in para ##graph ##s 26 and 27 regarding the jurisdiction of the EC Court of Justice in certain areas is a Treat ##y matter on which the European Parliament has already stated its opinion .
However , there is another asp ##ect that should wor ##ry us , which is the fact that , according to the Greek Government , there is strong evidence that many fire ##s were caused by organise ##d ar ##son ##ists .
We do have one quant ##ita ##tive target , however , which has been unc ##hang ##ed since the year 2000 .
In the long term , however , it remains to be seen which other measures are adopted in this respect .
However , there is still one fly in the o ##int ##ment : we wanted certificat ##ion of to ##ys by independent testing institute ##s , so that we can also be really sur ##e .
However , a minute ' s silen ##ce must make us reflect and also lead us to reflect on things that go beyond our imme ##dia ##te concern ##s here .
However , the Council must not try to ratio ##n information in order to save money .
However , there is an even greater rise in unin ##sure ##d , unc ##erta ##in employ ##ment , which not only does nothing to improve the population ' s standard of living , but also under ##mine ##s it .
In committee , however , we maintained a balanc ##e , to which Mr Ver ##he ##uge ##n referred and to which I also atta ##ch great importance , although it has sometimes been overl ##ook ##ed in this debate .
However , any ##one who think ##s that we will have solv ##ed anything by reduci ##ng carbon dio ##xi ##de emi ##ssions from the ever - increasing number of vehicles we use to 120 ##g or 95 ##g is grave ##ly mista ##ken .
Following fruit ##ful cooperati ##on between all three institutions , I believe that we have now reached our objecti ##ve , which is the establishment of a common frame ##work for the system ##atic development , production and diss ##emi ##nation of European statistic ##s on touri ##sm .
I am pleas ##ed that operator ##s will also have to comp ##ly with sustain ##ability cri ##teria and laws on indi ##geno ##us people ##s .
I am also happ ##y that agreement ##s could be reached with workers in the ship ##ping industry .
In the European Union , we have set the bar very high in this regard , which makes our products less competitive .
Commissioner , Mada ##m President , ladi ##es and gen ##tle ##men , against the back ##dro ##p of an economic and financial cris ##is , we must support the European Union in its efforts to achieve a more efficien ##tly run and effective tax system .
Mada ##m President , I should like to con ##grat ##ulat ##e Mr Lein ##en and the Commissioner on their brief ##ing .
on beha ##lf of the IN ##D / DE ##M Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the statistic ##s tell us that across the European Union there are more men than women in employ ##ment in every age group .
on beha ##lf of the PS ##E Group . - Mada ##m President , I think we are forg ##etti ##ng that it was this Parliament which first took up the campaign for an EU - wide ban on the cru ##el trade in seal products .
And , further to what Mr Schul ##z said about the danger ##s of a negative coming from Europe , it be ##hov ##es me , as a representative from Ireland , speaking at this round of the debate on the future of Lis ##bon , to point out a number of home trut ##hs .
It is in the interests of all European ##s to ad ##here to minimal conditions of employ ##ment and clear rules .
We in the Commission have made a declar ##ation that is contained in the minutes of the J ##HA council meeting of 23 October 2009 .
The EU ' s role as initiat ##or and coordinat ##or in strength ##enin ##g the single market is indi ##sp ##uta ##ble .
In national strategi ##c reports Member States set out how they will develop their polici ##es to meet the common objecti ##ves .
In some countries the remov ##al of the qua ##si - constitution ##al symbol ##s was actually used to argu ##e that there was no reason to hold a referendum on the Treat ##y of Lis ##bon .
A mechanism needs to be found for comp ##ly ##ing with the report ##ing conditions request ##ed by the European Commission in circum ##stance ##s where the provision ##s of the previous regulation on inform ##ing the Commission about investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community were not compli ##ed with by all Member States .
On Friday , the Irish were the last nation to express a positive view on the Treat ##y of Lis ##bon .
in writing . - ( DE ) Every tax system is accompanied by tax eva ##sion .
I voted in favour of this report on the mobi ##lis ##ation of the European Global ##isa ##tion Ad ##jus ##tm ##ent Fund ( E ##G ##F ) in support of the food industry employees ( UNI ##LE ##VE ##R ) in the Czech Republic .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Lis ##bon Treat ##y .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the suspen ##sion of the WT ##O Do ##ha Round .
The over ##arch ##ing objecti ##ve of development cooperati ##on is the era ##dica ##tion of pove ##rt ##y in partner countries , including purs ##uit of the Mill ##enni ##um Development Goal ##s ( MD ##G ##s ) .
I am in favour of the further protection of economic interests in locations where mineral water is explo ##ited , as gu ##aran ##tee ##d in the European Parliament ' s Direct ##ive on the explo ##itation and marketing of natural mineral waters .
in writing . - ( PT ) The fight against the serious public health problem of over ##weight - and obes ##ity - related disease must be a prior ##ity from the early stages of life .
in writing . - ( PT ) The costs associated with introduc ##ing ' intel ##lect ##ual property ' protection standards in the pha ##rmac ##eut ##ical sector in ' developing countries ' have been known about for a long time .
The reality which we have all realis ##ed is that the 2020 strateg ##y does not even have enough green or social polici ##es .
The group of amen ##dm ##ents to the EU ' s budget for 2010 which make up ' Bloc ##k 3 ' contains intervent ##ions and support measures that I oppo ##se as a matter of principle .
In EU policy , the internal contra ##dic ##tion between the quality of culture and of profit is reso ##lved only if the rut ##hle ##ss needs for profit are answer ##ed .
( Blue card question to Mr Far ##age under Rule 149 ( 8 ) ) Mada ##m President , I hope Mr Far ##age is not offen ##ded by a question from a citi ##zen of the Irish Republic .
In the communication review of EU policy on innovat ##ion in a chang ##ing world , issued on 2 September 2009 , the European Commission outl ##ines the development ##s that have taken place since 2005 in the field of EU innovat ##ion policy .
In the case of Turkey , the pre - accessi ##on assistance is not only benefit ##ing a non - European country , but is also , in some cases , disappear ##ing into the poc ##ket ##s of corru ##pt officials .
I have in my hand the letter from Janu ##sz Ś ##nia ##dek , the head of the Soli ##dar ##ity Trade Union , on this .
Every one of us , to a greater or less ##er ext ##ent , create ##s his own sense of belong ##ing to family , community , region , firm , church , society or political party , to the nation , to the civili ##sed world and , ultimately , to the population of this planet .
All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and ad ##equ ##atel ##y trained staff for the SO ##L ##VI ##T centre ##s .
The trut ##h is , of course , that we do not mean to impos ##e anything at all ; on the contra ##ry , we wish to offer a wide range of poss ##ibilit ##ies to help Member States who so desire to introduc ##e , in their own time , the ' poll ##ute ##r pay ##s ' principle into the road transport sector .
All these technical solution ##s are inter ##lin ##ked and , in our opinion , the rights of defence of defend ##ants must always be gu ##aran ##tee ##d in all circum ##stance ##s .
Every non - EU work ##er wish ##ing to settle in Europe will still have to get a residence permit first .
We all know that this is extremely important from the asp ##ect of the function ##ing of the European Financial Stab ##ility Fac ##ility .
According to its guide ##lines , the strateg ##y must bear in mind the statement ##s and concern ##s that we have deal ##t with in this House ; the need to fight against terrori ##sm , as well as the issues of human rights , the right to priv ##acy , and to protection of personal data .
You also mentioned in rep ##ly to me that the European Social Fund could be used for training .
In this context , the EU should strong ##ly back Taiwan ' s participation in the International Civil Aviat ##ion Organi ##sation and in the United Nations Fra ##me ##work Convention on Cli ##mate Change , as Taiwan ' s participation in these organisation ##s is important to the EU and global interests .
In this specific case , we believe that the emi ##ssion performance standards for new light commercial vehicles must not ignor ##e either the divers ##ity of the auto ##moti ##ve manufacturer ##s or the legitim ##ate interests and needs of small and medium - size ##d enter ##prise ##s in the various Member States .
We have a lot to learn from other European countries in this respect .
In this agreement , the stated objecti ##ves in relati ##on to development and integr ##ation at regional level are not in acc ##ord ##ance with the measures deploy ##ed to achieve them .
In any case reports to the Commission will be practic ##ally automatic , since they will be based on satellite survey ##s .
In the last few months , this National Council has set an example in these countries of Africa by organi ##sing a major process for the Guin ##ean people on the basis of the commit ##ments made by Mr Cam ##ara .
The launch of the new website at the start of 2009 is a wel ##come measure .
In that regard , I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SO ##L ##VI ##T network and the European consume ##r centre ##s .
I agree in this respect with my fellow Member , who is propo ##sing the creation of a single European access portal for all documents , with a structure which makes it easy for any ##one to understand .
As regard ##s research and development , you agreed that this is preci ##sel ##y where Europe ' s future lies .
For one can fight for democra ##cy only according to the rules of democra ##cy .
I am sati ##sf ##ied by the way in which the new European Commission Humani ##tari ##an Aid civil protection system is operating , by the help provided by the European institutions , and by the collaboration that has been established through the different agen ##cies .
We need to ensure that the few do not ta ##int the many and that our work benefit ##s from outside in ##put ##s rather than being dist ##orte ##d by it .
I also wish to than ##k rap ##port ##eur Un ##gur ##ean ##u for this compe ##lling and necessary report .
Deli ##ver ##y will require a collective effort by all stak ##eho ##lde ##rs at all levels .
I would like to end by mention ##ing that I am aware of the difference ##s between the views of Parliament and the Council when it comes to working time .
Un ##fort ##unate ##ly , that agreement is in contra ##dic ##tion with the common position and basic principle ##s of the European Union .
Un ##fort ##unate ##ly this is nothing new ; it is a growing phen ##omen ##on and , above all , one that can ##not be treat ##ed as an emergency year after year .
For some other political forces , human rights were less important .
Clos ##ing one ' s eyes to what has happened in Japan and preten ##ding that nothing has taken place is inse ##nsi ##tive and danger ##ous .
The cris ##is that has occurred in all sector ##s of the energy industry has led to the industry , which has wo ##ken up to climate change , not obtain ##ing the technology it needs quickly enough .
As a result of mel ##ting , the extra ##ction potential in the new territori ##es will increase to 200 m below the surface , involving million ##s of square kilometre ##s .
For this reason , I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas , but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published , what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued .
We must use strateg ##y papers for the different countries and other similar types of documents as the basis for the development of a co ##here ##nt strateg ##y relati ##ng to human rights in the country and the situation as regard ##s democra ##cy .
Next , you have to recognise the long - term stra ##in that pen ##sions are put ##ting on the government and make that very clear .
I would therefore ask the fundamental question of whether there really is any point continuing to was ##te billion ##s of euro on these European parties .
The conditions and principle ##s of trade on the global market therefore have important consequen ##ces for European agriculture .
It is therefore vit ##al that equal treatment is recognise ##d for workers placed by temporary employ ##ment agen ##cies , even in terms of wag ##es , in the user undertak ##ing .
It is therefore advis ##able to formula ##te a position which will safe ##guar ##d the interests of both consume ##rs and trade ##rs .
That is why it is important , in the future , that the report on competition should also focus on the lack of implement ##ation of the legislation which is already in place , and also on the lack of competition in the European economy .
I therefore believe that the necessary evalua ##tions should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absol ##ute ##ly necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be update ##d because , inter ali ##a , the Commission already saw the tarif ##f of EUR 176 per ton ##ne itself as low when it was implement ##ed .
The European Union should therefore continue to take an active approach to building positive relations with Turkey , inter ali ##a , by increasing funding for joint strategi ##c energy investment ##s such as the Nab ##uc ##co gas pipe ##line , and by means of greater support for the development of trade relations .
The report should thus take into account , for example , the geograph ##ical location of reserve ##s : this will contribut ##e towards more effective energy use and better energy security in the European Union as a whole .
There ##fore , with regard to the principle of subs ##idi ##arit ##y , there should not be any regulation at all at European level .
I therefore call on the Czech Pres ##ide ##ncy to ensure that this domestic problem is reso ##lved and that it serves as an example to the other EU Member States .
So , pleas ##e , when are we going to ac ##kno ##wle ##dge that agriculture . . .
There ##fore I have asked my services to en ##quir ##e whether such protection has been achieved and to examin ##e whether the rules of the Take ##over Bi ##d Direct ##ive have been respect ##ed by the Greek authorities in this case .
This is why I wel ##come and have supported the report by Mr Re ##ul on convention ##al sources .
We are therefore open to entering into the trade relationship ##s that best suit the Pacific region as a whole , and the on ##goi ##ng negotiat ##ions will inform the ultimat ##e choice ##s .
I therefore hope that the EU will take a strong , consisten ##t position to this conference , with ideas about the concrete measures that will be taken to gu ##aran ##tee the contributi ##on that bio ##div ##ersi ##ty protection will make to sustain ##able development .
I express my confid ##ence in the good jud ##gment of the European Central Bank , in the integrit ##y and independence of the European Central Bank and the politician ##s ' reserve to interf ##ere with this bank ' s decision ##s .
We must be aware that a repe ##titi ##on of last year could have real adv ##erse effects on food security within the EU .
To conclu ##de , I would like to than ##k you all again , and I hope that today ' s work is not the end of the story , but that we may be able to achieve even greater goals .
It is now up to the government ##s whether or not we will be able to put an end to the over - poll ##ution of the River Rab ##a and other European rivers in a similar situation .
There is now even a law that protect ##s the right of men to sexual gra ##tif ##ication without any say from the women involved .
A working group , chair ##ed by the Att ##orney General and consisting of the Secret ##aries of State for Defence and Home ##land Security and high level officials , has just started work .
Health ##car ##e systems are also cause for concern , as they often prove ina ##de ##quat ##e .
I would like specifically to pick up on Professor Mey ##er ' s comment ##s , as communi ##cated by Mr Schw ##ab .
We want the inhabitants of Kosovo to benefit from the vis ##a wa ##iver ; however , what ##ever the solution found , it must not prej ##udi ##ce the final arrangement ##s concern ##ing its status .
It is very important that this proper way of think ##ing gain ##s a firm foot ##hold in Bosnia and Her ##ze ##govin ##a ' s own political debate , so that its citizens can draw their own conclu ##sions about what sort of policy they have the right to expe ##ct from democra ##tical ##ly elected politician ##s .
I am very gra ##te ##ful in general for the work of this Parliament and its support on human rights issues .
We now see women in major roles in politics , business , industry and the media .
Institut ##ing these measures would great ##ly contribut ##e to preventi ##ng the situation from dete ##rior ##ating , and would help our grow ##ers to adapt to exception ##al circum ##stance ##s .
In particular , by agree ##ing to establish a European Stab ##ility Mech ##anis ##m and to make the linked Treat ##y change , we have demonstrate ##d our total commit ##ment to supporting the euro area and the Member States that use it for the benefit of the entire EU .
Scienti ##fic research shows that this sector is unique ##ly capable of capt ##uring carbon in a natural and non - poll ##utin ##g form .
The reform allows a relatively long transition ##al period because the part ##ly couple ##d aid can run until 2009 .
With each successi ##ve growth in numbers of parliament ##aria ##ns , working groups , committee ##s and plen ##aries have become un ##wi ##eld ##y and increasing ##ly ine ##ffe ##ctive .
